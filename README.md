# Solid OIDC Spa Tester

This application makes it easier to test how refresh tokens work using @inrupt/solid-client-authn-js functions with the Community Solid Server by decreasing the access token time to live to 30 seconds.

## To run:
```
npm i
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3001 for a UI to test and http://localhost:3000 for the Solid Pod.
